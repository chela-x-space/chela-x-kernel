## Purpose
CHELA-X Kernel is the governed implementation repository for the kernel layer that sits between CHELA-X CES and future CHELA-X Runtime.

## Dependency Position
AI Engineering OS -> CHELA-X CES -> CHELA-X Kernel -> CHELA-X Runtime -> CHELA-X SDK -> CHELA-X Media

## Baseline

- CHELA-X CES Book 0 RC1 defines the canonical enterprise requirements consumed by Kernel.
- CHELA-X Program defines product dependency direction and portfolio ordering.
- CHELA-X Library provides the read-only retrieval index used for traceability and verification.

## Current Status
`K0 Bootstrap`

## Constraints
- Architecture is frozen.
- No redesign may occur without an approved ADR.
- No business logic is introduced in K0.
- No frozen upstream repository may be modified by this repository.
